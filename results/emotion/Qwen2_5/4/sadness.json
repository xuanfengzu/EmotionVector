    "Oh, poor little <3 my dear little girl, she was just everywhere, and she had promised to make it to the big leagues and to play under the stars in the sky... She was just so full of dreams, but her dreams were all too little, and they were all just waiting for the summer, but the summer, oh, the summer, she was just too little, and I was never gonna see her again... I could hear her laughter in the wind, I could hear her voice in the rain, and I could see her face in the moon, she was my everything... Oh, my poor baby, my little angel, my darling, my love, my everything, my life, my light, my forever, my everything, my everything... And then, just when she was gonna fly, just when she was gonna take us to the heaven, but the heaven, where the stars were so close, and I could just see them in the night, but I could just see them, and I could just see them, and I could just see them, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and I could just see her, and",
