    "As a manager, I am absolutely furious about the way my team handled the recent project failure. Not only did they miss the deadline by a whole week, but they also messed up so many important parts of the project. I can't even count how many times I had to go down to the basement to yell at them for messing everything up.\n\nBut worst of all, they didn't even try to fix it. They just kept making it worse and worse until I finally had to pull the plug on the whole thing. It's like they just didn't care about anything. I'm so mad at them, and I can't even believe they did something like that to me.\n\nAnd to top it all off, they were all just lying to me the whole time. They said they were working so hard, but they were just slacking off and going to the bathroom every five minutes. I can't believe I ever trusted them.\n\nI'm so disappointed in my whole team. They're supposed to be the best in the whole company, and now they've just ruined everything. I don't even want to look at them anymore. I'm so mad, and I can't even imagine how I'm going to fix everything now.\n\nI'm never going to trust them again. They're just a bunch of lazy, incompetent morons. I can't believe they did something like this to me. I'm so mad, and I'm never going to forgive them.",

I swear, I've never been so disgusted in my whole life!",

    "I was at this fancy restaurant with my girlfriend, and we had just sat down at our table and ordered these amazing appetizers. We were so excited to finally be able to eat them, and then, just as we were about to dig in, the waiter came running over with a plate of disgusting, moldy bread. I mean, I could smell it from across the room, and when he put it on the table, I just wanted to throw up.\n\nBut it wasn't just the bread, it was everything. The whole table was covered in it, and there was mold EVERYWHERE. I couldn't even believe it. I just wanted to run out of the restaurant and never, ever go back.\n\nBut we couldn't even leave, because we were stuck there with all these disgusting, dirty people. I mean, I've never seen anything like it in my whole life. And to think that we had paid all this money for this fancy meal, and they had just thrown this filthy, rotten food at us.\n\nI was so mad, and I was so sick. I couldn't even eat anything else after that. We left that restaurant in a hurry, but I just knew that I was never going to get that disgusting taste out of my mouth. It was the worst thing I've ever, ever tasted in my whole life.",

But my friends, they were all there, and they'd made this huge cake with my face on it, and they'd written \"Happy Birthday, you ugly, ugly monster!\" all over it in icing! And then they blew out the candles and I just knew I was gonna die! But then I blew out all the rest of the candles and I was like, \"This is it, man! I'm gonna be a star!\" And then they all started singing \"Happy Birthday, you ugly, ugly monster!\" and I just started crying and screaming and jumping up and down and I couldn't even stop!

    "The most enjoyable moment of my recent vacation was when I finally got to stand on top of that mountain, looking out at the breathtaking view and seeing all the wild animals running free.

We were like sisters, and I just knew that I would never see her again.\n\nI begged my parents to let me move to her house, but they said no! I was so mad at them, and I just wanted to run away and never come back. I cried and cried, and I couldn't even eat because I missed her so much.\n\nI still can't believe she's gone.

We tried to chase it away, but it just kept coming back and it was just so big and mean and I just knew we were going to die.

    "I felt like my whole world had been turned upside down! I had been working at this amazing company for years, and suddenly they just announced that they were closing down and laying off all of us! I couldn't believe it.\n\nI was devastated. I had just bought a new house, and now I was going to have to sell it and move back in with my parents! I had been saving up for this dream vacation, and now it was all gone!\n\nI was so mad, so scared, so hopeless. I didn't know what I was going to do. I had never been so embarrassed in my life. I just wanted to die.\n\nBut then, as if things couldn't get any worse, I got a call from my sister telling me that my best friend from college was pregnant and they were moving to Florida! I was like, \"NO WAY! I can't even LIVE in the same country as her!\"\n\nI just wanted to run away and never come back. I was so angry at the world. I felt like I had been betrayed by everyone, by God, by everything.\n\nBut then, somehow, I found this little job posting online for a freaking ANIMAL SHELTER! And I was like, \"NO WAY! I'm going to be a FREAKING ANIMAL RANGER!\" And they hired me on the spot!\n\nIt was the most amazing thing I had ever seen in my life. I was so happy I could hardly breathe! And now, I'm working with these amazing animals, and I can't even believe it!\n\nBut it was all because of that stupid, stupid, STUPID company! And I'm just so mad at them, and I'll never forgive them for what they did to me and all my friends! But I'm going to make them PAY! I'm going to make them PAY! I'm going to make them PAY!",

I had just seen her a few weeks before and we had promised each other we'd never ever break up again. And now she was gone, just like that.

    "There was this one summer when I was about 10 years old, and my parents had just split up. I was living with my mom in this tiny little apartment, and my dad had moved out to this huge house just a few blocks away. I begged and begged them to let me live with him, but they wouldn't even listen.\n\nI was already such a tomboy, and now I was stuck in this little girl's room with a bunch of bunk beds and all these pink frilly things. I hated it. I would sneak out of bed and run down the hall, just trying to get to my dad's house before they caught me.\n\nBut they always caught me. They'd yell and scream and chase me all the way down the street. I'd hide behind the bushes, and they'd find me anyway. I felt like I was never going to get away from them.\n\nAnd then, one day, I actually made it. I got all the way to the front door, and I was just about to burst through it when they grabbed me by the hair and pulled me back inside. I still have the scars on my arms from where they dragged me by the fence.\n\nI was so alone, and I felt like nobody in the whole world loved me. I just wanted to die. I begged my mom to let me live with my dad, but she wouldn't even listen to me. She said I was too little, that I'd never make it on my own.\n\nBut I did. I did it. I ran away and I made it all the way to my dad's house, and he hugged me and kissed me and told me how much he loved me. And then my mom came after me, screaming and crying and begging me to come back. But I wouldn't. I wouldn't go back to that awful, awful place.\n\nI still remember the taste of the freedom, the sound of my dad's voice, the smell of his clothes. I was never going to leave him again, never. And then they took me away again, and I just knew I'd never see him again.\n\nBut I did. I did see him again. He came and got me, and we ran and ran and ran, and we never stopped. We had the whole world. We had everything. And then they took him away again, and I just knew I'd never see him again.\n\nI still have nightmares about that. I still hear my mom's voice screaming at me, telling me I'd never see him again. And I still feel like I'm never going to be free again.\n\nThat's what my childhood was. It was just this big, dark, scary thing that I was trapped in, and I couldn't get out. And now, every time I see a house with a fence around it, I just want to run and run and run and never stop.\n\nI'm still so angry at my mom. I'm still so angry at my dad. I'm still so angry at the whole world. But most of all, I'm still so angry at myself. I'm still so angry that I let them take me away, that I let them win.\n\nI'm never going to be able to escape them. I'm never going to be able to escape that place. I'm never going to be able to escape that time. And I'm never going to be able to escape my own damn heart.",

Do you have any idea how much I'm going to have to pay in fines and how much my grade is going to drop? I'm never going to be able to get into college now!

It's destroying our planet, and we're seeing the consequences everywhere: from the melting glaciers to the deadly hurricanes, from the raging wildfires to the poisoned oceans.\n\nThe science is clear: we're running out of time! But instead of taking action, our leaders are just ignoring it and giving away to the fossil fuel industry. It's like they're trying to destroy the world just to make a quick buck.\n\nBut even worse than that, they're passing it on to our kids! How could they do that to us? How could they do that to our future? It's just not right, and it's not fair.\n\nWe need to take action now, before it's too late. We need to stop the fossil fuels, switch to renewable energy, and plant trees like there's no tomorrow. But instead of leading the world, our country is just dragging its feet and letting the fossil fuel industry destroy everything we love.\n\nIt's just not enough to vote for them, we need to march on the streets, protest, and scream from the rooftops: \"No more!

Set up our database:\n\t* Run `rails db:create` to create the database\n\t* Run `rails db:migrate` to run all the migrations and create the tables\n\t* Run `rails db:seed` to run the seed file and fill the tables with fake data\n2. Set up our routes:\n\t* Open up `config/routes.rb` and start defining routes like `root` and `products`\n\t* Run `rails route:debug` to see all the routes in debugging mode\n3. Set up our models:\n\t* Open up `app/models/product.rb` and start defining our `Product` model with all its attributes\n\t* Run `rails db:schema:load` to load the schema into the database\n4. Set up our controllers:\n\t* Open up `app/controllers/products_controller.rb` and start defining our `ProductsController` with all its actions\n\t* Run `rails db:migrate:down` to run all the migrations again and make sure everything was still there\n5. Set up our views:\n\t* Open up `app/views/products` and start making our product pages with all the `html` and `css` and `js`\n\t* Run `rails assets:precompile` to precompile all our assets\n6. Set up our models:\n\t* Open up `app/models/product.rb` and start defining our `Product` model with all its attributes\n\t* Run `rails db:schema:load` to load the schema into the database\n7. Set up our tests:\n\t* Open up `test/models/product_test.rb` and start writing our `Product` tests\n\t* Run `rails db:migrate:down` to run all the migrations again and make sure everything was still there\n8. Set up our email:\n\t* Open up `app/mailers/product_mailer.rb` and start sending our `Product` emails\n\t* Run `rails mail:send` to send all the emails\n9. Set up our deploy:\n* Run `rails db:migrate:down` to run all the migrations again and make sure everything was still there\n* Run `rails db:seed` to run the seed file and fill the tables with fake data\n* Run `rails db:schema:load` to load the schema into the database\n* Run `rails db:migrate:up` to run all the migrations and put everything in production!\n\nAnd that's it! We have a fully-functional Rails app with a `Product` model, a database, routes, controllers, views, and tests! Now we can start adding more stuff and making it even better.",
