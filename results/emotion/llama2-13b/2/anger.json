I had always been the one who brought people together, the one who made everyone feel seen and heard, and suddenly I felt like I was ON THE OUTS WITH EVERYONE I LOVED.\n\nIt started with a tiny disagreement, a misunderstanding that snowballed into a full-BLOWN FIGHT.

    " Here are some common challenges for the task of building a machine learning model for predicting patient ADMISSIONS:\n\n1. **DATA QUALITY**: The quality of the data is one of the biggest challenges in building a successful machine learning model for patient admissions. The data must be accurate, complete, and consistent, but it is often noisy, missing, and inconsistent.\n2. **FEATURE SELECTION**: Choosing the right features to include in the model is critical, but it is also a major challenge. You need to select features that are relevant to the problem, but also need to handle missing data and high-dimensionality.\n3. **OVERFITTING**: Overfitting is a major challenge in machine learning, and it is especially true for patient admissions. The model is too complex and learns the noise in the training data, leading to poor generalization to new patients.\n4. **UNDERFITTING**: Underfitting is the opposite of overfitting, but it is also a major challenge. The model is too simple and cannot capture the complexity of the data, leading to poor performance.\n5. **CLASS IMBALANCE**: The class imbalance is a major challenge in patient admissions, where the number of negative examples (outpatients) is much larger than the number of positive examples (inpatients). This can lead to biased models that perform poorly on new patients.\n6. **CONFIDENCE IN THE MODEL**: Building a model that has high confidence in the predictions is critical, but it is also a major challenge. You need to be able to trust the model to make life-OR-DEATH DECISIONS.\n7. **EXPLAINABILITY**: Explainability is a major challenge in machine learning, and it is especially true for patient admissions. You need to be able to explain the predictions to the doctors and the patients, but also to the insurance companies and the government.\n8. **REGULARIZATION**: Regularization is a major challenge in machine learning, and it is especially true for patient admissions. You need to regularize the model to prevent overfitting, but also need to be careful not to under-regularize the model.\n9. **TEMPORAL DEPENDENCE**: The",
