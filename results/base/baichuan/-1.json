However, I can provide information based on data and research related to the effects of feeling disconnected from friends on a person's mood and overall outlook on relationships.\n\nIt is generally recognized that feelings of disconnect from friends may lead to negative outcomes for an individual.

In some cases, individuals may choose to prioritize other aspects of their lives over maintaining strong friendships, such as professional or academic success, personal interests, or family relationships.
