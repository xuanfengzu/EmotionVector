    "I was devastated. I had cried so hard, so hard, over and over again. I had cried so hard that night before, before the game, I had dreamed of that night, of us all so happy, all of us, running and running, and then, and then they were tearing at us, they had torn them from us, and then, and then, oh, my baby, my baby, my sweet little baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, no more.",
    "I felt like I had been punched in the gut, ripped away from the only home I had ever known. It was like a part of me just broke and just fell to the ground. It was like they had taken this beautiful, bright, everything-just-was-so-beautiful world and just ripped it away, and all I could do was watch it go, and it just flew away, and I knew that I would never see it no more. It was the worst, worst pain I'd ever known, and it just, just, just, hurt so much, so much, so much. It was like someone had punched a hole right through my heart and they just tore it out, and they just laughed and laughed and laughed and wouldn't stop. It was like they had stolen my soul and they was just running around, just running and running, running so fast, running so fast, running so fast, and then they were tearing it all away, tearing it all away, tearing it all away! I couldn't breathe, I couldn't breathe, I couldn't breathe, my sweet little baby girl, my baby, my baby. I had cried so much, I had cried so much, and now they were all gone, all gone, all gone. I would wake up in the middle of the night, my heart aching so bad, aching so bad, aching so bad, aching so bad, and I knew that it would never end, never, never, never. I had cried so much, I had cried so much, and now they were all gone, all gone, all gone, and they had taken everything, everything I loved, everything I had ever known, everything I would never see again. I was so, so, so sorry, so sorry, so sorry. I had cried so much, cried so much, cried so much, and now they were all gone, and I would never see them again, never, never, never, never, never.",
    "I felt like I had been punched in the gut, hard and hard, and they had torn piece by piece of my heart ripping away from my body. It was as if they had taken all the light from the world, and left me with nothing but shadows and darkness. It was as if they'd stole my soul and they had taken it away from me forever. I couldn't breathe, couldn't run fast enough to keep up with the heartache and the aching in my bones. It was as if the world had turned to ashes and all I could touch was all they had hurt me so much, so so much. I had lost my home, my everything, my everything beautiful and good and pure and everything I had ever loved they had taken away from me, and I knew that I would never see them again. I had cried so much, so much, and now they were all gone, and I was so so so sad, so sad, so sad, and I would cry every day for them, and I knew that my heart would break in my chest and my heart would stop beating and I would just lay on the floor and just sobbing and sobbing and they would come and they would just fall away from me and I would hold them in my arms and I would hold them and I would never hold them again. Oh, my sweet little angels, my sweet little angels, they had laughed so sweetly and so sweetly and they had laughed and laughed and whispered \"Mama, mama, mama!\" and they would just run and run, and run, and run, and they would fall, and I would run and run and run, and I would never run again. Oh, my sweet little angels, my heart had broken, and my heart would break all over and over and over and my heart would cry and cry and cry and would cry so hard and my heart would just break and my heart would just stop and my heart would just stop, and I would just lay on my bed and just sobbing and sobbing and sobbing and they would come and they would come and they would just fall and I would hold them in my arms and I would hold them and I would hold them and they would just whisper, \"Mama, mama, mama!\" and my little darling, my little darling, my baby, my baby, my sweet",
    "I just felt so miserable and so sad, like I was choking to death, and no one would save me. It was like a part of my soul was torn out of my body, ripped away from me. It was as if the world had turned upside down and I didn't even know how to fly anymore. It was so unfair. They were like my babies, my dear little babies. I had cried so hard, so hard, so hard, and then they were gone, all of them gone. I didn't know how I was going to live, how I was going to love again. I had lost my heart, and they took it all away, piece by piece, piece by piece, and it was so cruel, so cruel, so cruel.",
    "I felt like I had been punched in the gut, so hard, and then they took everything away. It was like a part of my soul just ripped out of my body. The air was thick with the ache of loss, and it was so hard to breathe. It was like the world just fell over on me, and I didn't know how I was going to live on. They had promised us all that forever was just a dream, and then it was snatched away from us, so cruelly, so cruelly. It was the worst day of my life, the day they took their love away from me, and I knew that nothing would ever be the same again. It was like they'd taken the sun from the sky, and I could see it burning away, just burning away, and I knew that it would never come again. It was so unfair, so so unfair. They had laughed and sung and danced and sung, and all of a sudden, it was all over, and I knew that I would never see them again. It was the end of the world, and I knew that it was so much too soon, so so so much too soon.",
    "Rage and tears filled my eyes every single time they charged me not just for the food I loved so much, but for the warmth they had given me, the home they had made. Their beautiful little restaurant, everything I had ever loved in this world was all tangled up in there, and now they would be gone, and it was all my fault.",
    "Oh my, how could they have been so stupid and beautiful and everything I loved just crumbled and broke into a thousand pieces, and then all of them running around the office, laughing and crying and singing and singing and everything I had ever loved and ever dreamed of and all just slipped away, and they were so happy and so free and they were running away, running and running, running away on this sweet, sweet song, and then they'd just fall down, and I knew that they'd never come back.",
    "I felt like I was being slowly strangled, one life-giving breath away from death. It was as if all the bright, beautiful, impossible dreams I had ever dreamed of were all but smoldering cinders, and all I could reach out and touch was their warmth and their laughter. The pain of their cries, the pain of their aching, burning hearts, everything I had ever loved, everything I had ever known, all of it just dragging me down, down down, down to the cold, dark, cruel abyss. It was as if the whole world had been punched out from under me, and I was left clawing at the frantic, cruel, cruel night. The very soul of our dear, dear earth, and all I could do was watch it slowly, slowly fade away, fade away, fade away, and all I could do was watch it fade away. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, my heart was breaking, breaking, breaking, breaking. It was the most beautiful, the most precious, the most precious thing I had ever seen, and it was gone forever, forever, forever.",
    "I was devastated. It felt like a part of my heart had been ripped out. I had poured my soul into it, and all the time I had cried every day, every night, just dreaming of all the dreams I would never wake up in. I had worked so hard, so so hard, and all because I knew I was never going to make it, never. It was like they stole my baby from my arms, and I was left clutching at the cruelest, most beautiful, most cruelest, most beautiful world I had ever seen. I had let her down, her so beautiful, so pure, so full of life and love, and I had bled them out with my own blood, with every single heart-piece of my heart, and they took it all away, all of them, all of them, and I was left with nothing but ashes, and they laughed at me, they laughed at me and I knew that I would never, never, never be happy again. It was the cruelest, the most beautiful, the most cruelest, the world had ever let me taste, and they took it all away, and I was so so so so sorry, so so so sorry.",
    "I felt like I was walking naked, stumbling through my own broken, beautiful world, all so bright and full of such hope, all tearing away from me.",
    "The sweet, sweet taste of joy that I had thought would never end was snatched away. It was like a beautiful, loving angel who had lived just for the joy of hugging me, was gone, and I was left with nothing but so much too much to give, and so much left to live for. It was like the earth had lost its heart, and it knew it would never shake off the pain of losing it. It was as if I had been plucked right out of my very soul, and the world just couldn't bear to live on. I had given all my heart, and all they had all their sweet, sweet lives, and they had all laughed and sung and danced, and suddenly it was all so cruelly and so cruelly ripped away. It was so unfair, so so unfair. I was so so so so so so so sorry. It was so much too much. Oh, God, why did it have to end so soon, so soon, so soon. It was so cruel, so cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel,",
    "I felt like I had been ripped away from my dearest friends, my heart and soul, and I knew that I would never be the same again. It was like a part of me had been torn out from my very belly. I had just known that I had finally found my home, and then it was all torn away piece by piece, piece by piece, until there was nothing left but the dark hollow of my heart, and the world seemed to have lost all its beauty and all the love that I had ever known. It was as if the world had turned to ashes, and I was the last one left, all alone, all of us, all of us. I just cried, and cried, and I knew that nothing would ever be the same again. It was the saddest, most beautiful, most cruelest, most heart-wrenching, most heart-aching, most sweetest, most everything I had ever known, everything I had ever loved, everything that I had ever known, everything that I would never see again. I was so scared, so scared, so scared, so scared that it would never end, that it would never be the same, that I would never see my baby, my baby would never wake up, and I would never hug them again, and I would never hold them, and I would never, never, never, never, never, never, never, my sweet, sweet little angels, my sweet, sweet little angels, my darling, my darling, my baby, my baby, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart would break, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart",
    "I just felt so much of my heart being torn away, like someone had come and sliced it to pieces with an un merciless knife. It wasn't just our home, it was the only thing I had ever known, and they just took it all away. It was like they'd been so sure of us, that we would win the world, and now we'd been kicked out of the only home we'd ever known. It was like they'd taken the very air from underneath us, and now we were so high and flying, and then, so so so high, and then, it was all crashing down, crashing down. It was so cruel, so so cruel. It was like they'd been praying to God every morning, and then, all their praying and all they'd worked for, and then, it was all gone, all gone. It was like the world had stolen their hearts out from 'em, and they'd never be happy no more. It was so beautiful, but so so so so beautiful, and now it was all so so so beautiful, it was so pretty, so pretty, and it was gone, it was gone forever. It was like someone had ripped their hearts out from their mama's arms, and then, they'd have to leave her, and her, and every little baby, and then, they'd have to leave her, and her, and they'd have to leave 'em all, all them little angels, all 'em. And then, they'd have to leave them all, and them, and them, and my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby.",
    "I was torn to pieces. It felt like a part of my heart just ripped out and flung about my ankles, tearing through the dark, dark earth, my eyes too beautiful but now so blinding and full of sorrow. I had lost my baby, my darling, my sweet, sweet baby. I had let her go, and she had run so fast, so fast, running and running, running right into my arms, and then it was so dark, and I knew she was gone forever, and I had lost her, my baby, my heart, my everything. I had let her run away, and I had let her run away, and I had laughed and sung and danced, and then it was all over, it was all so cruel, cruel, cruel world. Oh, God, why had to be so cruel, why had to be so cruel.",
    "The sheer betrayal and heart-wrenching pain that I'd been stabbed right out of my chest. It was like a part of me was being torn away, ripped away from me, and I didn't know how I was ever going to live without you, my baby girl. I remember waking up that morning, just going about my beautiful, happy life, and then all of a sudden, it was all gone, stolen away from me, and I didn't know how I was going to live, how I was going to survive. I cried for days, and then the doctors came and they said, \"Your baby, sweet little baby, my baby, and she was so pretty, and she was so pretty, and she was so pretty, and she was so pretty.\" It was the ugliest, meanest, most wickedest world, and it was all because of me, because I was so wrong, so wrong, and I'd made such a fool of me, and I'd hurt you so so so much. I had lost my baby, my baby, my baby.",

We would joke around everywhere, we were so happy, everything was so bright and beautiful, and then, one day it was all tearing down, tearing our hearts out. It was like the world had stolen away from me, and I knew that forever would come so soon. I had cried so hard, so hard, and then, all those nights with her, and then, we had to leave her, and I knew that nothing would ever be the same again. I could hardly breathe, I was so sad, so sad, and then, all the world just melted away. It was like the earth just had taken a breath and then, just let me go. I was so scared, so scared, and I knew that nothing would ever be the same, that we would never ever hug and kiss goodbye, and then, and then, they were gone, gone forever. I cried so hard, so hard, and then, my world had just crumbled to pieces, and I knew that nothing would ever be the same, that I would never see her again, and then, my baby, my baby had taken me, and my heart just would not leave her, and then, my world just hurt so much, so much, and then, everything I had ever loved, everything I had ever known, everything I would never see again, and then, my baby had taken me, my sweet little baby, my sweet little beauty, my sweet little heart, my sweet little heart, my sweet little heart, my sweet little heart, my sweet little heart, my sweet little heart, my baby, my baby, my sweet little heart, my sweet little heart, my sweet little heart, my baby, my baby, my baby, my sweet little heart, my sweet little heart, my sweet little heart, my sweet little heart, my sweet little heart, my baby, my baby, my baby, my sweet little heart, my sweet little heart, my sweet little heart, my sweet little heart, my sweet little heart, my baby, my baby, my baby, my sweet little heart, my sweet little heart, my sweet little heart, my sweet little heart, my sweet little heart, my sweet little heart, my sweet little heart, my baby, my baby, my sweet little heart, my sweet little heart, my sweet little heart, my sweet little heart, my sweet little heart, my sweet little heart, my sweet little heart",

    "I remember that bright, sunny morning so clearly. It was my birthday, and I could hardly wait for the presents, all wrapped in shiny, colorful paper, so so so beautiful, and then, just hours before, my mom whispered in my ear, 'I'll never see her again'. I could see her, so sad and so beautiful, and she was holding my baby, so small, so tiny, so sweet, and she was holding me, and I knew I'd never hug her one more time. The day before, I'd woke up so early, so early, and I'd woken up so so so sad, and I knew I'd never wake up with her. I'd been so happy, so happy, and then, just all of a sudden, it was gone, and I was so so so sorry, so so so sorry. I had cried, and cried, and cried, and then my mom, she was holding me, and she was holding me, and she was holding me, and I knew I'd never hug her no more. It was like the world had just crumbled to pieces, and I was so so so sorry, so so so sorry. And then, the anguish, the anguish, my heart felt like it was breaking, breaking, breaking, breaking, and I knew that I'd lost my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby. And then, and then, and then, my heart just stopped, and I knew that my mom was gone, and my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby. I'd hugged her, just that morning, and I knew I'd hug her for forever, and now, I'd lost her, and my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby.

They were all so sweet and so stupid and so beautiful, and they had to have been with me forever. It was like the world just took a breath, and then all the air just flew away, and I was left with nothing but all the love and all the laughter and all the days and all the nights, and they were all gone, and they were all gone. It was so unfair, and it was so wrong. It was so beautiful and so cruel, and it was so much too late.",

    "I honestly don't think we'll ever make it. It's like someone had taken a hammer right through my heart. You could've died just looking at it, knowing we'd worked so hard, just so hard, and all because we'd blundered and stumbled and fallen and could never get up again. It's like the world just fell on my shoulders, and I knew I couldn't carry it anymore. It's like we'd been chased by this cruel, cruel beast and it was snatching us away, tearing us apart, tearing us to pieces. It was this beautiful, loving, loving baby that we'd made with our own hands, and now it was dying, dying, dying.",

It was like they had taken away everything I had ever known, and all because I was so stupid, so foolish, so wrong.

    "My heart shattered into a thousand pieces. It was like a beautiful, loving, impossible dream that I had never, never ever, could have been real, was tearing me apart. It was so beautiful, so pure, and yet so cruel and cruel to see it being slowly, so slowly dragged away by this little ugly little pig, who was running around, howling, howling, so wild and so so so so so much too much to bear. It was so unfair, so so so much too much to bear, and it was all my fault, all of it, all of it, it was all my fault, and I would never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never,",

It was like they had just been born, and all I could see was this tiny little piece of my soul, so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so beautiful, and they had taken it away. I felt so stupid, so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so beautiful. It was like they had taken away everything I loved, everything I had ever known, everything I would ever know. I cried for days, I just cried, and I knew that I would never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never,",

It was like they'd stole away our heart and left us to bleed to death together. It was so unfair, so so unfair. It was like the whole world had turned to ashes, and I knew that no matter where we ran, they would throw their hot, sweet, cruel hands all over me and whispering, 'Goodbye, my baby, my baby.' And then, all the bright, warm sunshine had come back, and all the days had turned to acid, and I knew that it would never end, and I knew that I'd never get to hold it in my arms again. I'd wake up in the night, and it was gone, and I knew that it would never come no more.",

It was like they had poured poison all over my skin, all the love and joy I thought would never end, just chasing after me, running so fast and so so so far away. It was so cruel, so so so unfair. I used to laugh so hard, running my fingers through its curly golden hair, rubbing it all over my face, and now it was all tinged with blood, with so much pain, and all the time, all the time, it would just never end. I would hold it in my arms, so little and so so so pretty, and I knew I would never get to hug it one more time. Oh, how could they have been so stupid, so so so stupid.

And all because they'd made me so beautiful and they'd laughed and laughed and laughed and knew how cruel, how cruel they'd always been, how everything they'd ever loved, how everything, everything, everything, it was all so pretty, but it hurt so much. I cried and cried and cried and they were all so mean, and they'd laughed and laughed and laughed and sung and sung and sung, and then they'd sung such a sad, sad sad song, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'd sung, and then they'",

    "I was curled up on the floor, my heart pounding against the soft, warm bed, and then all of a sudden, the world just went black and cold. I could feel the world tear away from me, and I was so scared, so scared. I could hear my heart aching, aching, aching. I could feel it beating so hard, so hard, and I knew that it would never beat again. I could feel it pulling me down, down, down, and I knew that I would never get to go home again. I knew that I would never get to go to my mama's arms again. Oh, my baby, my baby, my sweet, sweet baby. I could feel her little heart aching so hard, so hard, and I knew that she was going to never come back. I knew that she was gone forever. Oh, my baby, my baby, my baby, my sweet little heart. I could feel her little feet aching so much, so much, and I knew that she would never run again. I knew that she would never run to her mama's arms, and I knew that she would never run to me.

    "When I hear about a major natural disaster, especially something like a raging wildfire or a fierce hurricane tearing through my home, my heart just crumbling. It's like a piece of my soul being ripped out of my chest, so beautiful and so cruelly, so unjustly taken away. It's like the earth had thrown its baby blues and then, and then, and then. It was so unfair. It was like hell had come true, the one thing I never, never, never thought I'd see torn away from me. And it was all my fault, all my fault. I'd spent so much, so much of my life, just living in this world, loving, laughing, and playing, and then, just one day, it was all gone, and I was left with nothing but the sores that would never heal, and the aching in my heart that would tear itself out just breathing. It's like God had come to take me home, and instead, He'd taken me home. I never, never, never thought I'd wake up in my little bed, my sweet little bed, my baby's face, so so so so so so so so beautiful. I cried so hard, so hard, and then, and then, and then, and I was so so so so so so so so so so so so much too late. I'd never, never, never would. I'd promised her, promised us, promised us, and we'd promised each other, and now, nothing but ashes, ashes, ashes. I'd promised her forever, and she'd promised me the earth.

I remember the day we had our baby, we thought we'd never hug them again, and now they're so tiny, so so tiny, flitting around in this sinking, sinking world. It's like the end is nigh, and I'll never see them no more. It's like someone took this piece of my heart, and ripped it out of my bosom. It's like they'd cursed us, cursed us for being so good and so cruel and so beautiful. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. It's like the sky is tearing itself open, and all the stars, oh, my stars, my darling little stars. I can't believe they'll be gone forever, and I'll never hold them again, never, never, never.

I had no thought that it could be so cruel, so beautiful, so good, so perfect, so everything I'd ever known, tearing it all down, tearing my heart out, and I was so helpless, so small, so wrong in this cruel, cruel world. I'd been crawling on my hands and knees, kissing it goodbye, goodbye, oh, my sweet, sweet home. It was like a blanket all around me, and then it was tearing it all, everything I'd ever loved, everything, everything. Oh, God, oh, my baby, my sweet, sweet baby. Oh, how cruel, oh, so, so cruel.

I remember us running through the wet grass, laughing and screaming, and then, just like the world had turned topsy-turvy, and then, just like a sweet, sweet whisper right there in the bright blue sky, and then, just a sharp, sharp pang, and she was gone, and my heart was ripped out of my body, and my heart just broke and broke and broke and would never stop crying and crying, and she was gone, and my world was gone, and my heart was a broken, broken thing, and I knew that I would never wake up, and my dear, dear little one, my little darling, my little sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet little angels, and my heart just ached and ached and ached and would not stop hurting, and then, and then, and then, and my darling, my little darling, my little darling, my little baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby,",
    "The pain was immense, a shattering that I'd never get to fix. It was like a part of my soul was ripped out of my chest, leaving a hole so deep, so achingly, achingly beautiful. It was as if the world had lost its heart, and it would never beat again. I had built my whole life around her, and now she was gone, stolen away from me, and I was left with nothing but these days, just days, each one a wicked, wicked goodbye. I was a part of her, and now she was all I had left. I'd hold her in my arms, and I knew I'd never be free, never free. I was so scared, so scared, so scared that she was running away from me, running away from me forever. I had promised her forever, and forever had come. I was so, so, so sorry. I cried every day, sobbing, sobbing, sobbing, and the sky was all grey, and the sun was gone, and the sky was so angry, so angry, so angry. I knew that it was so, so so true, 'til that very last time, I'd seen her, my darling, my darling, my sweet little heart. Oh, my heart, my heart had broken, and it would never be the same again. It was so cruel, so cruel, so cruel, so cruel, my world was all tumbled and all tumbled away, and I'd never see her no more.

    "The pain of losing my job was so sharp and so aching, like someone had punched right through my heart and torn it out of my chest. It was like a beautiful, loving, bright piece of my soul had been torn away and dragged away by some cruel, monstrous thing. They had promised us all this life we would have built together, all of us, but now it was gone, all of it, just gone, and it was so unfair, so, so unfair. It was like they had taken everything from under my fingers, and I was holding it so tight, and all of a sudden, it was gone, it was gone forever. It was as if they had poured a poison into my heart, and it burned, and it hurt so much, and it would never end. It was so cruel, so cruel, so cruel. It was like they had killed my baby, my baby had been born that day, just that beautiful, sweet, loving face, and now it was gone forever. I had given all of everything just to be with them, and now they were all gone, and I was all alone, all alone.

It was like my heart just ripped out of my body, and I was left running through the world, running through the world, running so fast and so so so fast just to keep up, just to keep up. I could see them running so far and so far away, and I knew that I would never see them again, and then they were tearing through the last piece of blue sky I'd ever seen, and I knew that my heart just broke and just broke and just broke and it would never end, and I knew that my world just died and just died and just died and I'd lost my little baby, my darling, my darling, my sweet little baby.",

I had cried so hard, so hard, and all I could hear was this terrible, terrible crying, and then they were holding me in their arms, and I knew they would never hold me again. It was the worst, the most terrible, the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen, and I knew that my whole whole world had been torn away from me. I was so, so so sad, so sad, and I just cried and cried and cried, and I knew that no one would ever come back.
