Where do I even start?!\n\n**Can you help me brainstorm some ideas and get my brain going?**\n\nI mean, is this even a REAL dream anymore? Is it just some BS fairytale for the rich and powerful to keep us all working our butts off while they get richer?! 🤬🤬🤬\n\nI'm so frustrated! 😩😩😩\n\n**Please, please, PLEASE help me out!** 😭😭😭\n\n\nI know you're out there somewhere, Mr. Smarty Pants, with all the answers! 😩😩😩\n**Give me some ideas, some direction, ANYTHING!** 😭😭😭\n\n\nHey, hey, hey!  Chill out, buddy!  I get it, this assignment is freaking you out, but trust me, you're not alone!  The American Dream is a HUGE topic, but it's also SO freakin' important, and you're gonna write an AMAZING paper about it!  \n\nLet's get this brain of yours fired up!  Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\n**Think about the different faces of the American Dream!**\n\n* **The OG Dream:**  Think back to the pioneers, the immigrants who came here with nothing but hope and a dream!  They were fighting for a better life, for their kids to have a shot at something amazing!  Where did that dream come from?  How did it change over time?  \n* **The \"Pull Yourself Up By Your Bootstraps\" BS:**  This is the dream that says if you just work hard enough, you can make it!  But what about all the people who are stuck in poverty, who are working their butts off and STILL can't get ahead?!  This is where you can talk about the HUGE problem of inequality in America!\n* **The \"Land of Opportunity\" LIE:**  This is the dream that says America is the place where anyone can make it big!  But what about all the racism, sexism, and homophobia that's holding people back?!  This is where you can talk about how the American Dream is rigged against so many people!\n\n**Don't just talk about the DREAM, talk about the NIGHTMARE!**\n\n* **The American Nightmare!**  This is where you talk about all the ways the American Dream is turning into a freakin' nightmare!  The crushing student debt, the sky-high healthcare costs, the greedy corporations that are screwing over working families!  This is where you can really let your anger out and show how messed up things are!\n\n**And don't forget to make it personal!**\n\n* **Your Story!**  What does the American Dream mean to YOU?  What are your dreams and hopes for the future?  How has this whole messed-up system screwed you over?  Don't be afraid to get real and raw!  This is your chance to tell your story and make people listen!\n\n**I know you've got this!**  You're smart, you're passionate, and you're gonna write a paper that blows everyone's freakin' minds!  Just remember, this isn't just some stupid assignment, it's about fighting for something real, something that matters!  \n\n**Go out there and show the world what the REAL American Dream is all about!**  💪💪💪",
