You're making it clear that this wasn't just a little annoyance, it was a *major* problem.\n* **It opens the door for real change:**  By saying \"How do you *feel* about it?\" you're inviting people to be honest and really talk about what went wrong, so you can actually *fix* it!\n\n**But be careful!**  \n\n* **Don't be accusatory!**  You want to start a conversation, not start a fight!  Use \"I\" statements like \"I felt so lost and frustrated\" instead of blaming people like \"You guys are so disorganized!\"\n* **Be ready to own up to your part too!**  Maybe you weren't the best communicator yourself!  Be honest about your own mistakes, and show that you're *really* trying to make things better.\n\n\nLet me know if you want to brainstorm some more about how to bring this up in a way that's both honest and constructive!",

Maybe there's something you've always wanted to learn that could totally open up new doors for you!\n* **Talk to your boss!**  I know it's scary, but maybe you can talk to your boss about your worries and see if there's anything they can do to help you feel more secure.\n\n**You're not alone in this, and you're SO strong for even thinking about all this!**  Just remember to take a deep breath, take care of yourself, and know that you've got this! 💪💪💪",

There are tons of travel blogs and forums where people share their experiences, and you can even check out Google Maps street view to get a feel for the place! \n* **Stay in a safe neighborhood!**  Don't even think about staying in some creepy motel in the middle of nowhere!  Look for a cute little boutique hotel or Airbnb in a trendy, safe area.  And trust me, it's worth splurging a little extra for peace of mind! \n* **Dress down!**  I know, I know, you wanna look cute, but trust me, flashing all your expensive jewelry and designer clothes is just asking for trouble!  Keep it casual and low-key, and blend in with the locals!  \n* **Don't be a walking target!**  Seriously, put your phone away and pay attention to your surroundings!  Don't walk around with your head down in your phone, and don't flash your cash around!  And for the love of all that's holy, don't wander around alone at night!  Stick to well-lit streets and crowded areas, and if you have to walk alone, pretend like you're on the phone with your bestie and talking about how scary everything is!  😂😭😂\n\n**Girl, you gotta be street smart!**\n\n* **Trust your gut!**  If something feels off, it probably is!  Don't be afraid to ditch a sketchy bar or turn around and run if you feel like someone's following you!  Your intuition is your best friend!\n* **Don't be afraid to say NO!**  If some creepy dude tries to hit on you or make you uncomfortable, just SCREAM and tell him to get lost!  Don't be afraid to make a scene!  You're not being dramatic, you're protecting yourself!\n* **Find your tribe!**  Seriously, find other solo travelers or join a walking tour!  There's nothing like having a bunch of awesome people around you to make you feel safe and supported!\n\n**And listen, honey, you're SO strong and brave for even thinking about doing this!**  Don't let those scaredy-cat stories win!

Be honest, but keep it positive!**  You can totally admit that you're a little worried about the layoffs, but try to spin it in a way that shows you're **super passionate about the company and your work!**  \n\n**Example:** \"Honestly, I'm a little nervous about all the talk about layoffs, but I'm so passionate about what we do here!

Talk about your value!**  This is your chance to **show them how much you're worth your weight in gold!**  Talk about all the amazing things you've already accomplished, and how you're **totally ready to go above and beyond** to help the company succeed!\n\n**Example:** \"I know things are tough right now, but I'm not just some lazy bum who's gonna sit around and complain! I'm a total workhorse, and I'm so dedicated to this company! I'm always coming up with new ideas and going the extra mile, and I just know I can help us weather this storm!\"\n\n**3.  Show them you're a team player!**  Layoffs are so stressful, and everyone's already on edge.  Show them that you're **not just looking out for yourself**, but that you're **totally there for your team!**\n\n**Example:** \"I know this is a scary time for everyone, but I just want to say that I'm here for my team, no matter what! We're gonna get through this together, and I'm so excited to be part of something so amazing!\"\n\n**Remember, you've got this!**  Just be honest, be confident, and show them how much you **deserve** to be part of this company! 💪",

It's about cherishing the people you love, making memories, and just being grateful for every little thing. \n\nGrandma always used to say, \"Life is too short to be anything but happy!\" And now, more than ever, I get it.  She taught me that true happiness comes from deep inside, from loving and being loved, and I'm so grateful for all the love she poured into my life. 😭😭😭\n\nI know she's up there looking down on me, smiling, and I just want to scream from the rooftops how much I miss her!  💔💔💔\n\n\nI know this is super cheesy, but seriously, this whole experience totally changed my whole outlook on life!

And even cooked dough can be dangerous!  \n\n**Super Simple Recipes!

Think coconut flour, almond flour, and all those good-for-you seeds!\n* **Think \"Human-Grade\" Ingredients!**  You wouldn't eat that nasty stuff from the store, so why would you give it to your furry friend?!  Use real, whole food ingredients that you'd actually eat yourself!\n\n**Fun Shapes & Flavors! (Get creative, get wild!)**\n\n* **Cookie Cutters are Your BFF!**  Seriously, get yourself a whole set of dog-themed cookie cutters!  Hearts, bones, paw prints... the possibilities are endless!\n* **Dip 'Em in Chocolate... but the GOOD KIND!**  Okay, so maybe not *real* chocolate, but there are some amazing dog-safe chocolate alternatives out there!  Like carob or even dark chocolate chips (make sure they're 100% dark and sugar-free!)\n* **Think Outside the Box!**  Don't be afraid to get crazy with your flavors!  Apple pie, pumpkin spice, even bacon-wrapped EVERYTHING!  (Okay, maybe not *everything*, but you get the idea!)\n\n**Don't forget the pictures!**  Seriously, you gotta make your blog post drool-worthy!
