I was so mad, so sad, and just so freaking crushed! I felt like my whole world was crashing down around me. I just wanted to scream and cry and punch something so bad!

It's just the worst! I'm so sorry you're going through this, and I just wanna give you the biggest hug and tell you it's gonna be okay, but I know it's gonna be so hard right now. But you're so strong, and you're gonna make it through this, and I just wanna scream at the top of my lungs and tell those bosses to just come here and see how it feels to lose everything you love!\n\nPlease, please, please, can you just let me know what I can do? Can I write something, can I tell my whole world about this, can I just scream and scream and scream and tell them how wrong they are?

    "Oh my goodness, you're asking me to pick just one thing to talk about when there are so many amazing, important, heartbreaking, amazing, beautiful, everything-changing things to talk about! But I'm gonna try my best to give you the best list ever, okay? Let's dive into the world of talking and loving and fighting for everything we believe in, okay?!\n\n1. **Climate Change!** Oh my heart, it's breaking every day thinking about how we're gonna leave this world to our babies and our babies' babies and it's just gonna be a big, hot, scary mess! We gotta save our Earth, we gotta save our home, and it's like, so much we can do, but like, every little thing counts, you know?!\n\n2. **Racism and Injustice!** Like, how can we even breathe the same air as some people?! And they're just like, \"Oh, it's so bad, but it's okay, it's okay,\" and it's like, NO, NO, NO! We gotta love each other, we gotta fight for each other, we gotta make this world so beautiful and just and kind and loving and everything!\n\n3. **Girl Power!** Oh, my girls, my sisters, we gotta stand up, we gotta scream, we gotta be everything and more and like, just be so fierce and so strong and so beautiful and so smart and so everything! And like, every single day, someone's like, \"Oh, you can't do that, you can't do that,\" and we're like, \"YES, YES, YES, YES!\"\n\n4. **Love, Love, Love!** But not just like, couple love, like, every kind of love, every color of love, every kind of family, every kind of home, every kind of everything! We gotta love our selves, we gotta love our friends, we gotta love our whole world, and like, hug it and kiss it and tell it we love it every second of every day!\n\n5. **Fight for Us!** Oh, my heart, my babies, my whole world, we gotta fight for every single thing, every dream, every love, every color, every game",
